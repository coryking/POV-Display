# LED-POV Display Project

## Overview
This project is an ambitious attempt to create an LED Persistence of Vision (POV) display. It features a spinning disk equipped with LEDs to create visual patterns and images. Currently, the repository focuses on developing a PID motor control system to maintain a steady RPM, essential for the POV effect.

## Project Status
**Note:** This project is a work in progress and in its early stages. It's more of a hobby/passion project, and significant functionalities are still under development.

## Features
- **PID Motor Control**: The primary focus as of now is on achieving a stable RPM for the spinning disk using PID control.
- **Future Developments**: Additional features and functionalities will be added in due time.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32**: The core microcontroller used for motor control.
- **A3144 Hall Effect Sensor**: For RPM detection.
- **OLED Display**: Compatible with the U8G2 library, used for real-time display of system status.
- **Rotary Encoder**: To provide user input.
- **Brushed Motor with L298N Driver**: For the spinning mechanism.

## Software and Libraries
- The project is developed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), an open-source ecosystem for IoT development.
- Dependencies and specific library versions are managed via PlatformIO.

## Installation and Setup
Currently, there are no specific installation and setup instructions available, as the project is still in the development phase.

## Usage
The LED-POV Display is not yet ready for general use. More instructions will be provided as the project progresses.

## Contributions
Contributors are welcome to join this project. However, please be aware that the project is in its early stages and not fully functional yet. Any contributions towards achieving a stable motor control system or other aspects of the project are highly appreciated.
